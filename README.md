# Project Euler - Test-Driven Development

A C# repository containing a series of programming solutions to the mathematical problems found at
https://projecteuler.net/archives

The purpose of creating this repository is to practice test-driven development in Visual Studio 2022 (VS2022).

The repository contains a .sln file, which should be opened with VS2022. Within this "Solution", two projects and one console application can be found. One project contains the classes used to solve the Euler Problems, another project contains the classes used to test the problem-solving classes, and a console application is used to execute the methods needed to solve the Euler Problems.

Publishing solutions to the first one-hundred is acceptable according to the "About" section of the Project Euler website, which is visible after registering on the site. The solutions posted here are for my own personal use for practicing test-driven development.
