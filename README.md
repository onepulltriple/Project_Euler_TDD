# Project Euler and Test-Driven Development using C#

This C# repository contains a series of programming solutions to the mathematical problems found at:
https://projecteuler.net/archives

The purpose of creating this repository is to practice test-driven development in Visual Studio 2022 (VS2022).

The repository contains a .sln file, which should be opened with VS2022. Within this "Solution", two projects and one console application can be found. One project contains the classes used to solve the Euler Problems, another project contains the classes used to test the problem-solving classes, and a console application is used to execute the methods needed to solve the Euler Problems.

Publishing solutions to the first one-hundred problems is acceptable according to the "About" page of the Project Euler website:
https://projecteuler.net/about#publish
The section which discusses publishing of solutions to the first one-hundred problems is visible after registering on the site. 

The solutions posted here are for my own personal use for practicing test-driven development.
